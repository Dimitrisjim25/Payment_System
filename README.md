My apologies! I completely missed that instruction. Here is the same concise, high-level README.md, translated into English as requested.

Modular Payment System
This project implements a foundational Payment System architecture, designed with a microservices approach to clearly separate concerns between payment processing and user management. Its purpose is to demonstrate core functionalities and serve as a flexible foundation for future development.

1. Architecture & Purpose
The system is composed of two distinct API services, developed to operate independently, allowing for autonomous development, scaling, and deployment of each component:

Payment Service (FastAPI): Responsible for all payment-related operations, including integration with third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe). It was chosen for its asynchronous support, essential for efficient management of external API calls, and its strong typing.

User Management Service (Flask): Manages basic user data and related functionalities (CRUD). It was selected for its simplicity and flexibility, making it ideal for quick creation and management of user resources.

This separation highlights microservices principles, providing a clean structure for a payment system.

2. Key Considerations
Data Security: Sensitive interactions with the payment gateway are handled exclusively on the server-side. API credentials are managed via environment variables, ensuring that critical information is not embedded in the codebase and is not tracked by version control.

Typing Limitations: Due to specific versions of third-party libraries (e.g., Stripe SDK), there may be limitations in strict typing. Practices have been implemented to maintain functionality without compromising security.

3. Project Structure
The project follows a clear, modular structure, with each service residing in its own distinct folder:

payment_system/ # Project Root Directory
├── payment_api/                # FastAPI application folder (Payment Service)
└── user_management_service/    # Flask application folder (User Management Service)
├── requirements.txt            # List of all Python dependencies required for the project.
└── README.md                   # This documentation file.
# Other development/configuration files (e.g., virtual environment, cache directories) are present and automatically excluded by version control.
4. Future Outlook
This project serves as a foundation and can evolve into a full, production-ready system with the following enhancements:

Persistent Data Storage: Integration of a database for user and transaction data persistence.

Authentication & Authorization: Implementation of robust security mechanisms to protect API endpoints.

Payment Webhooks: Handling asynchronous payment status updates from the payment gateway for complete transaction lifecycle management.

Frontend Application: Development of a user-friendly interface.

Containerization & Deployment: Utilizing technologies like Docker for consistent environments and deployment to production infrastructure.

Comprehensive Testing: Implementation of automated tests to ensure quality and stability.
