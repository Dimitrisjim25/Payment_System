Modular Payment System

This project implements a foundational Payment System architecture, designed with a microservices approach to separate concerns between payment processing and user management. It demonstrates core functionalities using modern Python web frameworks.

1. Architectural Overview & Services
The system is composed of two primary API services:

Payment Service (FastAPI): Handles all payment-related operations, primarily integrating with a third-party payment gateway.

User Management Service (Flask): Manages basic user data and related functionalities (CRUD).

This modular design allows for independent development, scaling, and deployment of each component.

2. Technical Decisions
2.1. Framework Selection
FastAPI for Payment Service: Chosen for its asynchronous support (ideal for I/O-bound operations like external API calls), type safety via Pydantic, and rapid development with automatic OpenAPI documentation.

Flask for User Management Service: Selected for its simplicity, lightweight footprint, and ease of prototyping for basic CRUD operations.

2.2. Payment Gateway Integration (e.g., Stripe)
Utilizes the Stripe SDK (stripe==6.6.0) for creating checkout sessions.

All sensitive interactions with the payment gateway are handled server-side.

Type-checking limitations due to missing type stubs in the Stripe SDK are managed with typing.Any and # type: ignore to maintain functionality.

3. Project Structure & File Functions
The project maintains a clear, modular structure:

payment_system/ # Project Root Directory
├── payment_api/                # FastAPI application folder (Payment Service)
│   ├── main.py                 # Main FastAPI application, defines payment endpoints.
│   └── stripe_utils.py         # Utility functions for Stripe API interactions and payment processing logic.
└── user_management_service/    # Flask application folder (User Management Service)
    └── app.py                  # Main Flask application, defines user management (CRUD) endpoints.
├── requirements.txt            # Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
└── README.md                   # This documentation file.
# Other development/configuration files (e.g., virtual environment, cache directories) are present and automatically excluded by version control.
4. Current Functionality & Development Status
This project demonstrates core functionality and architecture with the following characteristics:

No Persistent Storage: User data is currently stored in-memory only. A robust database solution is required for production use.

No Authentication/Authorization: API endpoints are unauthenticated. This system is suitable for local development and testing only and should not be exposed publicly without robust security measures.

No Payment Webhooks: Asynchronous payment status updates from the gateway are not handled. Implementing webhooks is essential for a complete payment flow.

No Frontend: Relies on direct API requests (e.g., curl or browser) for interaction.

Simplified Product Model: Currently supports a single, generic product for payment processing.

5. Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher.

pip, virtualenv (or venv module).

Access to a compatible payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to obtain necessary API credentials.

Steps
Clone Repository:

Bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd payment_system
Create & Activate Virtual Environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
# Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:
Ensure requirements.txt exists (content below) and run:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt content: fastapi==0.101.1, uvicorn==0.23.2, python-dotenv==1.0.0, stripe==6.6.0, flask==2.3.3

Configure API Credentials:
Proper configuration for external services (like the payment gateway) is required. Please refer to the specific setup documentation for handling sensitive API credentials securely in your local environment.

6. Testing
Services can be started individually (e.g., uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 for FastAPI) and tested via curl or a web browser.

Payment Service (FastAPI): Access /checkout/?price=X (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/checkout/?price=50) to initiate a redirect to the payment gateway's hosted checkout page.

User Management Service (Flask): Use POST requests to /users for adding users and GET requests to /users for listing.

7. Troubleshooting
Pylance Errors (Type Checking): Any and # type: ignore comments are used due to known limitations with third-party SDKs' type stubs.

API Credential Issues: Ensure all necessary API credentials for external services are correctly configured in your local environment variables.

8. Future Improvements
To evolve this into a production-ready system, key enhancements include:

Database Integration: For persistent storage of user and application data.

Authentication & Authorization: Implementing robust security mechanisms for API access.

Payment Webhooks: Handling asynchronous payment status updates from the payment gateway.

Frontend Application: Developing a user-friendly interface.

Enhanced Error Handling: More granular and informative error messages.

Containerization & Deployment: Utilizing Docker for consistent environments and deploying to production-grade infrastructure.

Comprehensive Testing: Implementing automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
